Websites For Hope (WFH) gives back to society by providing web designing and website creation services to Singaporean non-profits for free. Creating websites is what I love to do, and this is simply my own way of giving back to society, one website at a time. Please contact me at [lee-victoria@live.com][0] for more information.
