> In my mind, a factory of dreams continue to run without ever stopping - Daniel Armand Lee

Hello! My name is Victoria and I have many dreams that I am working towards fulfilling. I have loved reading since young, and it led to my love for English and English literature. Since then, I have always dreamt of being a journalist and writer. When I discovered graphic design and website creation during my secondary school days, it was love at first click. I fell in love with the idea that I could create whatever I visualised in my head through a graphic or a website. I self-learnt graphic designing through photoshop and html coding and spent most of my free time designing and coding. My dream then evolved to become a writer, journalist and a web designer and developer. Studying creative writing and new media in polytechnic only fuelled my passion and I decided to start doing freelance work as a writer, graphic designer and web designer and developer. During my time as an English literature undergraduate, I continued to write and design and my dream evolved again. Inspired by my teachers, I  tried teaching and it was a life changing experience. I am now en route to becoming a trained teacher and I hope to integrate my love for literature, writing, design, new media and media into my lessons. I also hope to continue dabbling in my passions through Websites for Hope and volunteerism, and would be delighted to help local non-profits who need help in the various areas mentioned above.
