> In my mind, a factory of dreams continue to run without ever stopping - Daniel Armand Lee

My name is Victoria and this was the first domain I bought back in 2011\. I was just a 18 year old then, and I remember how excited I was back then to have bought my very own domain name. 

Through the years, Factoryofdreams.net has gone through many visual changes. It has been my learning and testing ground for many of my trials and errors in web design and development.
